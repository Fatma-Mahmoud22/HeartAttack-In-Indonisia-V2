  - chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes are among the most influential risk factors.
  - Body Mass Index (BMI) and cholesterol levels—especially in the “very high” and “normal” ranges—showed a strong association with increased risk.
  - While behaviors like poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol use, and stress showed a consistent upward trend in risk, they appear to be influenced by other contributing       factors.
